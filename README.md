# Phils Just Another Text Editor - Module 19

The just another text editor is progressive webapp containing the ability to save notes offline/online. It contains a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case the browser is offline.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- IndexDB
- Express.js
- PWA
- Heroku

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Node.js packages:

- `express` for interacting with the database routes.
- `IndexDB` for interacting with the browser-based database.
- `Heroku` for deploying the application

You can install these by running `npm install` in the root directory of the project. Then do `npm start`

## Usage

Use the deployed URL to open the deployed application. The content will be saved in indexeDB and you can set your browser to offline in the network tab.
